q52	The program extends RecursiveTask, not RescursiveAction; therefore the compute() method must return a value.

q56 
The methods on lines 3, 4, 6, and 7 can be performed on a BlockingDeque reference, not a Deque reference; therefore the code will not compile and E is the correct answer. If the method signature were corrected to take a BlockingDeque instead of a Deque, then the answer would be G, because the Deque may be blocked at runtime when the offerFirst(), offerLast(), pollFirst(), and pollLast() operations are called. Finally, if they were not blocked and there were no other operations on the Deque, then the output would be 8 3, and C would be correct.

q60 should be C E
