// A non=empty array A consisting of N integers is given. Integer X and Y are also given. 
// Look for the longest leading fragment of array A in which there is an equal number of occurrence of X and Y. More formally, looking for the largest index P, 
// such that 0<=P<N and the occurrence of X equals the number of occurrence of Y in the sequence of A[0], A[1]...,A[P].
// If no such value exists, return -1.

// For example:
// X=7, Y=42, A = {6, 42, 11, 7, 1, 42} 		-> P should be 4
// X=6, Y=13, A = {13, 13, 1, 6}				-> P should be -1
// X=100, Y=63, A = {100, 63, 1, 6, 2, 13}		-> P should be 5
