How to study data structures and algorithms to rock your interview

The key to studying is to maximize the time you have by studying the most high-value topics. That means you shouldnâ€™t study everything. After a certain point, your time would be better spent elsewhere, so focus on core data structures and algorithms.

Study hash tables and linked lists. Review sorting and searching, trees and graphs, arrays and strings. Know how to implement and use these things in your language of choice.
